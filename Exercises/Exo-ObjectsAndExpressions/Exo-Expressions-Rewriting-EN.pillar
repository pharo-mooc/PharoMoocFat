!Rewriting Expressions


In this exercise we ask you to rewrite some expressions or to understand the difference forms that a solution can take. Some of the expressions are explained in *https://medium.com/concerning-pharo/elegant-pharo-code-bb590f0856d0*


!!! Exercise: Examine the block expressions

[[[
| sum |
sum := 0.
#(21 23 53 66 87) do: [:item | sum := sum + item].
sum
]]]

- What is the final result of sum?

- Rewrite this piece of code to use explicit array indexing (with the message ==at:== ) to access the array elements. Test your version. 

- Rewrite this code using ==inject:into:== (Look at the implementation of ==inject:into:== and its users in the system to understand how to use it).


!!! Exercise: Comparing expressions

You can express in different way the same computation. Have a look at each of them and check the messages that you do not know. Look for their implementation. 

[[[
| array |
array := #(2 4 4 4 5 5 7 9).
((array - array average) squared sum / (array size - 1)) sqrt 
]]]

[[[
[ :input | ((input - input average) squared sum / (input size - 1)) sqrt ] 
    value: #(2 4 4 4 5 5 7 9) 
]]]

[[[
#(2 4 4 4 5 5 7 9) in: [ :input |
    ((input - input average) squared sum / (input size - 1)) sqrt ]
]]]

[[[
#(2 4 4 4 5 5 7 9) stddev
]]]
